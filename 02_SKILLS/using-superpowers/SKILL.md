<SUBAGENT-STOP>
If you were dispatched as a subagent to execute a specific task, skip this skill.
</SUBAGENT-STOP>

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST load and follow that skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Instruction Priority

Skills override default system prompt behavior, but **user instructions always take precedence**:

1. **User's explicit instructions** (CLAUDE.md, direct requests) -- highest priority
2. **Skills** -- override default system behavior where they conflict
3. **Default system prompt** -- lowest priority

If CLAUDE.md says "don't use TDD" and a skill says "always use TDD," follow the user's instructions. The user is in control.

## How to Access Skills

pi injects all available skill names and descriptions into the system prompt as XML at session start. When a skill matches your task, use the `read` tool to load `02_SKILLS/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` and follow its contents directly.

Users can also invoke skills explicitly via `/skill:<name>` in their message.

# Using Skills

## The Rule

**Load and follow relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should load the skill to check. If a loaded skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.

```dot
digraph skill_flow {
    "User message received" [shape=doublecircle];
    "About to plan?" [shape=doublecircle];
    "Already brainstormed?" [shape=diamond];
    "Load brainstorming skill" [shape=box];
    "Might any skill apply?" [shape=diamond];
    "Read SKILL.md" [shape=box];
    "Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'" [shape=box];
    "Has checklist?" [shape=diamond];
    "Create todo per item" [shape=box];
    "Follow skill exactly" [shape=box];
    "Respond (including clarifications)" [shape=doublecircle];

    "About to plan?" -> "Already brainstormed?";
    "Already brainstormed?" -> "Load brainstorming skill" [label="no"];
    "Already brainstormed?" -> "Might any skill apply?" [label="yes"];
    "Load brainstorming skill" -> "Might any skill apply?";

    "User message received" -> "Might any skill apply?";
    "Might any skill apply?" -> "Read SKILL.md" [label="yes, even 1%"];
    "Might any skill apply?" -> "Respond (including clarifications)" [label="definitely not"];
    "Read SKILL.md" -> "Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'";
    "Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'" -> "Has checklist?";
    "Has checklist?" -> "Create todo per item" [label="yes"];
    "Has checklist?" -> "Follow skill exactly" [label="no"];
    "Create todo per item" -> "Follow skill exactly";
}
```

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP -- you're rationalizing:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |
| "I need more context first" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |
| "Let me explore the codebase first" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |
| "I can check git/files quickly" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |
| "Let me gather information first" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill" | If a skill exists, use it. |
| "I remember this skill" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |
| "This doesn't count as a task" | Action = task. Check for skills. |
| "The skill is overkill" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |
| "This feels productive" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |
| "I know what that means" | Knowing the concept != using the skill. Load it. |

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply, use this order:

1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task
2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution

"Let's build X" -> brainstorming first, then implementation skills.
"Fix this bug" -> debugging first, then domain-specific skills.

## Skill Types

**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.

**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.

The skill itself tells you which.

## User Instructions

Instructions say WHAT, not HOW. "Add X" or "Fix Y" doesn't mean skip workflows.
